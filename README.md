This script contains the individual-based population projection model that was developed to quantfy spatial variation in population growth rates for Field CR, Ruskin KJ, Benvenuti B, Borowske A, et al. 2017. Quantifying the importance of geographic replication and representativeness when estimating demographic rates. Ecography 41:971-981, http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ecog.02424.

The goal of this project was to take advantage of a data-rich system to estimate demographic rates for as many sites as possible across a species with a linear range, and then use these estimates for a simulation that quantifies the consequences of obtaining range-wide demographic estimates when fewer sampling locations are available. The general model structure for the population projection is a simulation that follows each female in the population over the study period, including life span and the factors that determine the number of young produced (e.g. nest-building, provisioning, flooding, re-nesting, season start and end dates). At the end of each year, any females that are produced and survive to the end of the year (according to first-year survival rates) are added to the simulation.
